#Data Cleaning Project
#Data Storytelling Project

== Business Context
#Business: Online Wholesale Restaurant Supply Store which provides beverages, paper products, catering supplies etc to restaurants and 
	caterers. It is a specialized merchandise ie grocery shop
#Useful Resources
https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/dealer-vendor-trader-monger-merchant.813275/
https://ecommerce-platforms.com/glossary/merchant
manufacturers -> wholesalers (customers) -> retailers (customers) -> consumer
verdor (seller), merchant, reseller, integrator, distributor

#Audience : Sales and Marketing Executives (non-tech decision-makers) interested in seeing the product that scaled and the product that didn't scale, 
and understanding how this varies by branch. Also interested in knowing the branch that made the most and least profit (their expectations)
This visual will answer for when executives are trying to know what branch(es) to double down efforts or what products to do 
more advertising for, so sales would soar. They want recommendation on whether to hire more employees, categories moving faster or slower etc.

#Assumptions : We assume that the customers first sales transactions day represents the customers registration date or date of onboarding

== Data
#Source
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/codemysteries/salesdb
Modified data to make it more intuitive and real (data cleaning)

#Additional Features to Derive

== ASSUMPTION ABOUT Me:
#Role
I am an expert analyst who has been hired to discover with speed and accuracy, interesting and important opportunities worth exploring
	further and business problems worth solving from the business data

#Steps
1. Read up on business and industry modus operandi
2. Understand the data (data dictionary not provided)
3. Clean the data
4. Jot down interesting initial insights from the data (creating CONTENT)
5. Determine focus metric and create story that resonates with this focus metric (sales and employee performance)
6. Draw a dashboard of what I expect to create with a visualizing tool (upload snapshot to Github account) (deciding on the VISUALS)
7. Create a dashboard with Tableau Public and create a Presentation Deck with the snapshots from the Tableau Dashboard. Some features may be
	derived in Tableau. Prefix them with derived.
	Goal is to craft a compelling data story or narrative that will inpire decision-makers to take an action ie invest in 
	exploring the opportunities and business problems I recommend in my presentation. Craft your data story to be laser focused on 
	showing and communicating your recommendations (focus metric) so drop all the not-so strong points from the visual display
	(DELIVERY)

#Presentation Deck
1. Assumption about the business context, and stakeholders and stakeholder expectations and my task
2. Snapshot of data and assumptions made
3. Visual that captures occurence of event or focus of analysis over a period of time in the past. Make comparison on growth or performance 
	across time period to answer stakeholder expectation
4. Give some insights from the visual
5. What is the big takeaway - stakeholder should act or not act and implication of acting and also of not acting
6. Make statistical projection of growth in X number of years. Header should describe action that is recommended. Statistical projection, 
	visualized on chart will make the story more compeling
#SUMMARY of 3 to 6:
a. What is the expectation of the client? That becomes the pivot or focus of discovering when exploring the data
b. What does the past data say about this expectation / focus comparing it across branches, time etc. Historically what has been the trend.
c. What are the statistical projections regarding this expectations. The header should state the recommendation and the visuals should 
	support the recommendation

#Ideas
A
- Data Extraction Date
- Timeframe
- Users (Customers) = X+ (discount, loyal, need-based customers)
- Distinct Items = 452
- Distint Categories = 20
- Revenue

B
- Inventory dashboard (modify date indicates date products were received from the manufacturer distributors)
- Performance dashboard - Sales, Employees
- Growth dashboard (customers, sales, revenue, employees, platform engagement etc)
- Usage dashboard

- https://towardsdatascience.com/data-driven-growth-with-python-part-1-know-your-metrics-812781e66a5b

C
- Decide on metric for quantifying business problem
- Give topline numbers
- Slice topline numbers according to region, customer type, sales day of week, sales week of month, sales time of day

#Future Work
1. Convert data cleaning notebook to general script that can scale in cleaning similar data
2. Clean pre_process.py
3. Customer Analytics
4. Time Series Analysis (Sales Forecasting)
5. Market Basket Analysis
